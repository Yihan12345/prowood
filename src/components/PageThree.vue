Deposit is still due up front, however VAT payments are only due on the monthly payments. Transfer of ownership is possible with involvement of a third party to buy it from. Practically it is a simple administration process without further complications, however, the Inland Revenue tries to tighten up transfer of ownership but up to now it is legally acceptable. The purchased machine cannot be shown as an asset in the balance sheet but the monthly rental costs are deductible from the taxable profit.</h3>
