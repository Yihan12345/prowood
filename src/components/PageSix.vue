                            In the past banks liked to secure loans with a “fixed and floating charge” over all the assets of the company. This resulted in a deadly dependency on the good will of the Bank Manager.

                            Many have experienced the banks’ logic to withdraw the umbrella when it rains and offer it back when the sun shines.

                            The situation becomes worse when a directors guarantee becomes a condition of any loan arrangement. This is dangerous and also morally not justified in a world where the personal efficiency of a Managing Director is only one of the many factors deciding the fate of the company.

                            Modern financing should be related to the subject to be financed. Long term bank loans should finance buildings, working capital should be financed through the collateral of outstanding debtors and capital goods should be financed by the prospective viability of the undertaking.

                            The seller of asset finance should be able to discuss with the company the benefit of the proposed acquisition, “the pay back time” and offer technical and commercially based alternatives. Also one has to view future plans, expansion and foreseeable changes which could reflect back on the investment strategy in order to keep control of costs.

                            Unfortunately, for legal reasons, finance can only be offered to companies in the UK and Northern Ireland.</span>
