            <p class="p-md-5">50% of all contracts with ProWood are never terminated as contracted. Customers have to exchange and update machinery in order to follow requirements of productivity, quality and product development.
                <br><br>
                Traditional finance houses would apply hefty penalties and complex procedures because they are unable to dispose of outdated equipment. In cooperation with NEY these machines find their market again.
                <br><br>
                ProWood is able to accept new applicants more or less on the spot whilst traditional finance houses have to go in search of balance sheets and this takes time.
                <br><br>
                Unforeseen developments or new challenges need to be discussed with people who understand your production problems and the market.
                Both NEY and ProWood employ people who possess this expertise and are available for consultations with our customers.
