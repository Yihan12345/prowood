                        <p>This is the best justification for the existence of our company.
                            <span class="d-none d-md-inline">Without the chains and restrictions of government supported schemes we have set up many starter companies.
                            Not every company succeeded, however there are today a smaller number of millionaire companies which started from scratch with the help of ProWood Finance.
                            We are looking primarily into the ability and determination of the owner, his markets and planned products, when deciding to approve finance.</span>
                            Obviously balance sheets or other historic records are non-existent in the case of starter companies.
                            Our specialists will advise about the most prudent and bold ways to move ahead.</p>

                        <h3>Restructuring companies:</h3>
                        <p>Most companies are managed by partnership between two people - the technical person and the sales person.
                            <span class="d-none d-md-inline">Such partnerships also include married couples. If the business is successful often enough the partnership breaks down and a split is unavoidable with financial consequences.</span>
                           In this case we are prepared to support the efforts to continue the company by refinancing equipment and machinery or whatever the individual case requires.
                           It is very rewarding to work with our customers on positive ideas and to discuss the way forward.</p>
