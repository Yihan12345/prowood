                        <h3 class="fs-6">This is a popular route originated in the car business. The method is similar to “Finance Leasing” but the contract is set up for a period of between 1 – 5 years. The Finance Company retains ownership during this period and the machine is returned after the contract period. The contract can be prolonged or changed according to the wishes of the customer. The advantages are that there is a lower deposit and VAT is added to the monthly payments which are fully tax deductible. Although the customer does not have the benefit of the residual value, he also does not have the problem of disposing of a used machine therefore keeping the cost of production under control. A benefit to companies who like to show low asset value and optimised profits. We believe this increasingly popular method of finance will gain a much larger market share in the future with the focus on viability and profitability.</h3>
